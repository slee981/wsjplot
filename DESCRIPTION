Title: Style Timeseries Plots Like the Wall Street Journal
Description: Easily override the default visual choices in ggplot2 to make 
    your timeseries plots look more like the Wall Street Journal. Specific theme design 
    choices include omitting x-axis grid lines and displaying sparse light 
    grey y-axis grid lines. Additionally, this allows to label the y-axis scales 
    with your units only displayed on the top-most number, while also removing the 
    bottom most number (unless specifically overridden). The goal is visual 
    simplicity, because who has time to waste looking at a cluttered graph?
